# AlcoSensing

## What is AlcoSensing?

AlcoSensing is part of master's degree research project at Queen Mary University of London.

This project is looking into the effects of alcohol consumption and how these effects can be detected using mobile sensors and machine learning techniques. The app captures mobile sensor data and sends surveys to the user about their recent drinking.

You must be at least 18 years old to take part in the AlcoSensing study.

AlcoSensing is powered by SensingKit (http://www.sensingkit.org) and ResearchStack (http://researchstack.org).

## What do you mean "mobile sensors"?

Mobile sensors are the parts of your phone like the GPS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Light sensor and so on. All of these sensors produces data in the form of numbers, representing things like how quickly you’re moving your phone, how bright or loud the room is, your location and so on. 

Don’t worry, we’re not interested in exactly what you do with your phone. We’re only interested in data. AlcoSensing won't record your calls or access your contacts. We won’t be able to read what’s in your messages and we won’t be able to look at your internet use, photos or the content of any other apps.

## What do the surveys involve?

After AlcoSensing records some data, we’ll send you a notification asking you to answer three quick questions about any alcohol you may have consumed during the sensing period. We’ll ask if you had anything to drink, how much you had to drink, and how drunk you felt. Just answer the questions as accurately and truthfully as you can.

## So what happens if I install the app?

It's really simple and hassle free:
1. Download from the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joedarby.alcosensing1
2. Read through the information inside the app.
3. Sign up by providing some information about yourself (email address, age, height, weight, etc.)
4. Leave AlcoSensing running on your phone. Every 2-3 days you'll see a notification saying "AlcoSensing is currently gathering data"
5. Some time after the app gathers data you'll get another notification asking to complete the survey.

## How does the prize draw work?

As a thank you for taking part, everyone who keeps the app installed for long enough to complete 10 surveys will be entered into the prize draw.

Two people will be randomly selected to each receive a £20 Amazon voucher, funded by the university.

If you don't want to be included in the prize draw, you can opt out inside the app during the sign up.
